## Final LinkedIn Post: Operation Civic Earworm

> **What if civics education worked like a field manual, moved like a playlist, and spread like a meme?**
>
> That question started as a side project. It’s quickly becoming something much bigger.
>
> **Operation Civic Earworm** is a creative civics initiative that blends AI-assisted songwriting, curriculum development, and PSYOP-inspired influence architecture to teach pro-social, nonviolent, rights-based behavior in high-stress environments — civil unrest, protests, and law enforcement encounters.
>
> It’s weird. It’s catchy. And it works.

We’ve released an open-source curriculum, backed by an evolving library of music, lesson plans, infographics, and narrative materials — all designed for educators, organizers, and communities looking for scalable tools to reinforce civic competence and emotional regulation under pressure.

The music is available on commercial platforms for ease of access, but the **curriculum is fully open-source**. We’re inviting educators, artists, and field practitioners to contribute, remix, and build with us — while retaining full ownership of their work.

### ⚖️ A Quick but Important Note

**This project is not politically aligned.**
 It does not advocate for any party, candidate, or ideology.

*Operation Civic Earworm* is built on **nonpartisan civic principles**:

- Respect for civil rights
- Protection of constitutional freedoms
- Support for public safety
- De-escalation and lawful behavior under pressure
- Empowerment of individuals to navigate high-stakes environments without violence

The goal is simple: **civic readiness for everyone.**

### 🤝 About Sponsorship & Structure

**Operation Civic Earworm is sponsored by MCT Security**, but it operates as an **independent creative initiative**, orchestrated by the same principals and grounded in the same mission:

- Behavioral resilience
- Rights-based education
- Situational awareness
- Lawful decision-making under stress

This structure allows for open collaboration, rapid development, and broader reach — while staying rooted in real-world crisis and security experience. As well as some JFKSWCS driven tactical and operational elegance.

### 🎯 Why This Matters to the Crisis Management & Security Community

At **MCT Security**, we focus on resilience, decision-making, and behavior in complex, dynamic environments. *Operation Civic Earworm* aligns with that mission — not just through policy or training, but through **culture**.

In a time where distrust is high and attention is fragmented, influence doesn’t start with force. It starts with:

- Familiarity
- Repetition
- Emotionally resonant cues that **stick** when stress levels rise

This project explores:

- Behavioral inoculation against escalation
- Decentralized civic literacy
- Open-source doctrinal messaging
- Psychological safety through shared language

We’re building a toolset that empowers people *before* the crisis hits.

### 🧠 Volunteers We Need

- Music educators & performers
- Social studies & civics teachers
- Curriculum developers
- Civic activists & field trainers
- Protest organizers
- Media collaborators (yes, podcasts and tiktoks count)
- You.

If this sparked something — an idea, a critique, a question — I want to hear it.

**DMs are open. The GitHub is public. The mission is live.**

Let’s see how far this goes.
